    "# **Linear Regression Lab**\n",
    "#### This lab covers a common supervised learning pipeline, using a subset of the [Million Song Dataset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YearPredictionMSD). Our goal is to train a linear regression model to predict the release year of a song given a set of audio features.\n",
