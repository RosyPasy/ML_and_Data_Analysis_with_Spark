    "#### This lab covers a common supervised learning pipeline, using a subset of the [Million Song Dataset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YearPredictionMSD). Our goal is to train a linear regression model to predict the release year of a song given a set of audio features.\n",

Each string starts with the label (a year) followed by numerical audio features. Use the [count method](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.count) to check how many data points we have.  Then use the [take method](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.take) to create and print out a list of the first 5 data points in their initial string format."
