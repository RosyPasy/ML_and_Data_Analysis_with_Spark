    "# **Text Analysis and Entity Resolution**\n",

    "#### Entity Resolution, or \"[Record linkage][wiki]\" is the term used by statisticians, epidemiologists, and historians, among others, to describe the process of joining records from one data source with another that describe the same entity. Our terms with the same meaning include, \"entity disambiguation/linking\", duplicate detection\", \"deduplication\", \"record matching\", \"(reference) reconciliation\", \"object identification\", \"data/information integration\", and \"conflation\".\n",
    "#### Entity Resolution (ER) refers to the task of finding records in a dataset that refer to the same entity across different data sources (e.g., data files, books, websites, databases). ER is necessary when joining datasets based on entities that may or may not share a common identifier (e.g., database key, URI, National identification number), as may be the case due to differences in record shape, storage location, and/or curator style or preference. A dataset that has undergone ER may be referred to as being cross-linked.\n",

    "#### Besides the complete data files, there are \"sample\" data files for each dataset - we will use these for **Part 1**. In addition, there is a \"gold standard\" file that contains all of the true mappings between entities in the two datasets. Every row in the gold standard file has a pair of record IDs (one Google, one Amazon) that belong to two record that describe the same thing in the real world. We will use the gold standard to evaluate our algorithms."
