    "#### One of the most common uses of big data is to predict what users want.  This allows Google to show you relevant ads, Amazon to recommend relevant products, and Netflix to recommend movies that you might like.  This lab will demonstrate how we can use Apache Spark to recommend movies to a user.  We will start with some basic techniques, and then use the [Spark MLlib][mllib] library's Alternating Least Squares method to make more sophisticated predictions.\n",
    "#### For this lab, we will use a subset dataset of 500,000 ratings we have included for you into your VM (and on Databricks) from the [movielens 10M stable benchmark rating dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). However, the same code you write will work for the full dataset, or their latest dataset of 21 million ratings.\n",

    "#### As mentioned during the first Learning Spark lab, think carefully before calling `collect()` on any datasets.  When you are using a small dataset, calling `collect()` and then using Python to get a sense for the data locally (in the driver program) will work fine, but this will not work when you are using a large dataset that doesn't fit in memory on one machine.  Solutions that call `collect()` and do local analysis that could have been done with Spark will likely fail in the autograder and not receive full credit.\n",
